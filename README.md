These are the ansible roles, test playbooks, and vagrant virtual machines for development and testing, for the CCDC 2024 year. 

In order to set up, a few requirments are needed:

* Nix, with flakes. I recommend the [Determinate Nix installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer/)
* Libvirt, up and running
* Vscode, with the Ansible extension
